Play with JS/CSS/HTML so simple it hurts, the web playground that works offline.

## Why

> Aren't there already JSBin/CodePen/JSFiddle?

Yep! So why not one more? And this one could work **offline** for you!

How? `codepan` is just a single page app with **no-backend**! Built with Webpack and Vue.js, and the offline feature is provided by [offline-plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin).
